# ECEC-Simulator

A microsimulation model of the U.S. early childhood education and care (ECEC) market. Simulates behavioral responses to policy interventions by solving for equilibrium between childcare demand (families) and supply (providers).

## Overview

ECEC-Simulator evaluates childcare policy proposals by:
- Modeling family decisions over employment and childcare arrangements using a structural discrete choice model
- Solving for market equilibrium prices across four care sectors
- Computing fiscal costs, distributional impacts, and poverty effects
- Decomposing effects into mechanical (policy generosity) and behavioral (response) components
- Projecting outcomes forward across multi-decade horizons (e.g. 2026-2055)

**Data Foundation**: IPUMS USA (ACS), NSECE (National Survey of Early Care and Education), Tax-Simulator output, Macro-Projections

## Model Flow

1. **Processing** - Process NSECE (supply-side) and ACS (demand-side) microdata. Imputes earnings (Heckman selection), childcare enrollment and prices (random forest), employment (random forest), taxes (percentile-based donor matching), and SPM poverty units.

2. **Calibration** - Estimates CRRA demand parameters (beta, rho) by targeting empirical elasticities. Backs out household-level preference heterogeneity (alpha matrices) from observed/imputed choice probabilities.

3. **Simulation** - For each year: ages the population, applies macro projections, loads policies, and solves for market equilibrium. Post-equilibrium, expands with Gumbel epsilon shocks and collapses to discrete choices via argmax.

4. **Output** - Writes level summaries and delta files (scenario minus baseline), generates formatted Excel workbooks.

## Key Design Features

### Equilibrium

Solves for market-clearing prices across four care sectors (unpaid center-based, low-priced center-based, high-priced center-based, paid home-based) using L-BFGS-B with warm-start from the previous year. Demand is multinomial logit over (employment, care type, care hours) choices; supply is constant elasticity labor supply.

### Parent Unit Types

Families are classified into 2 types by number of children:
- **c1**: 1-child families (45 choice alternatives)
- **c2plus**: 2+ child families (675 choice alternatives)

Each choice combines: primary caregiver employment (FT/PT/NW) x child care arrangements (type x hours per child).

### Two-Stage Choice Simulation

1. **Equilibrium**: Uses softmax probabilities (smooth, differentiable)
2. **Post-equilibrium**: Expands with Gumbel epsilon shocks, collapses to discrete choices via argmax

### Effect Decomposition

Results decompose policy impacts into mechanical (pure generosity change at baseline behavior) and behavioral (additional impact from changed choices) components.

## Policy Channels

The simulator supports five independent policy channels, all specified per-scenario in the runscript CSV:

| Channel | Config directory | Function | Description |
|---------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| Demand subsidies | `config/policy_demand/` | `do_demand_policy()` | Returns subsidy matrix (n_units x n_choices) |
| CDCTC | `config/cdctc/` | `do_cdctc_policy()` | Child & Dependent Care Tax Credit |
| Supply | `config/policy_supply/` | `do_supply_policy()` | Transforms market prices to supplier-received prices |
| Tax credits | `config/policy_tax/` | `do_tax_policy()` | CTC-like credits that modify total tax by employment status |
| Employer subsidies | `config/employer_subsidy/` | YAML config | Percentage or dollar wage subsidies to providers |

See existing policy files for function signatures and examples.

## Runscripts

Scenarios are defined in CSV files under `config/runscripts/`. Example from `report_runs.csv`:

```csv
id,policy_demand,policy_supply,policy_cdctc,policy_tax,employer_subsidy,wage_floor,years,phase_in_years
baseline,baseline,baseline,baseline,baseline,none,none,2026:2055,
universal,universal,baseline,baseline,baseline,none,none,2026:2055,5
means_tested,means_tested,baseline,baseline,baseline,none,none,2026:2055,5
```

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `id` | Scenario identifier (first row must be `baseline`) |
| `policy_demand` | Demand policy file (without `.R`) |
| `policy_supply` | Supply policy file |
| `policy_cdctc` | CDCTC policy file |
| `policy_tax` | Tax policy file |
| `employer_subsidy` | Employer subsidy config (without `.yaml`) |
| `wage_floor` | Wage floor config (without `.yaml`) |
| `years` | Year range, colon-separated (e.g., `2026:2055`) |
| `phase_in_years` | Optional linear ramp from 0% to 100% over N years |

Not all columns are required. Simpler runscripts (e.g., `speed_test.csv`) can omit columns that have defaults.

## Output Structure

```
{output_root}/{timestamp}/
├── metadata/
│   ├── run_info.txt            # Command line args and runtime parameters
│   └── runscript.csv           # Copy of the runscript used
├── estimation/                 # Processed data, models, calibrated params
└── simulation/

            ├── levels/         # Absolute values
            └── deltas/         # Differences from baseline
```

Each scenario also gets an Excel workbook with formatted summary tables.

## SLURM Parallelization

Simulation years can be processed in parallel via SLURM job arrays:

```bash
./slurm/launch_array.sh -r report_runs -a 20 -n 20 -N 202602052017 -f
```

Three-phase architecture: (1) setup — processing + calibration, (2) year workers — one SLURM array task per year, (3) finalize — combine results and write output.
