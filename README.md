# ECEC-Simulator

A microsimulation model of the U.S. early childhood education and care (ECEC) market. Simulates behavioral responses to policy interventions by solving for equilibrium between childcare demand (families) and supply (providers).

## Overview

ECEC-Simulator evaluates childcare policy proposals by:
- Modeling family decisions over employment and childcare arrangements using a structural discrete choice model
- Solving for market equilibrium prices across four care sectors
- Computing fiscal costs, distributional impacts, and poverty effects
- Decomposing effects into mechanical (policy generosity) and behavioral (response) components
- Projecting outcomes forward across multi-decade horizons (e.g. 2026-2055)

**Data Foundation**: IPUMS USA (ACS), NSECE (National Survey of Early Care and Education), Tax-Simulator output, Macro-Projections

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Short | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `--runscript` | `-r` | Runscript ID (required, e.g., `speed_test`) |
| `--nsece-interface` | `-N` | Reuse NSECE data from prior run |
| `--acs-interface` | `-A` | Reuse ACS data from prior run |
| `--calibration-interface` | `-C` | Reuse all estimation data (NSECE + ACS + calibration) from prior run |
| `--baseline-interface` | `-b` | Reuse converged baseline results from prior run (skips baseline equilibrium solves) |

**Interface hierarchy**: Each level implies the ones below it: `-C` includes ACS + NSECE; `-A` includes NSECE; `-N` is standalone.

**Baseline reuse** (`-b`): Because the baseline is policy-invariant, a completed run's converged baseline (equilibrium prices, employment shifts, collapsed choices) can be reused, roughly halving run time when iterating on counterfactual policies. Requirements — enforced by startup validation and per-year integrity assertions:
- Identical baseline policies, `--calib-sample`/`--sim-sample`, `--seed`, and `-n` as the source run
- Same estimation data — combine with `-C` pointing at the same run (e.g., `-r my_runs -C 202603111322 -b 202603111322`)
- The source run must cover every year in the current runscript, and its baseline must have converged in each

Percentage-type employer subsidies additionally need equilibrium wages in the source run's `supply_<year>.yaml`, which older runs predate.

## Model Flow

1. **Processing** - Process NSECE (supply-side) and ACS (demand-side) microdata. Imputes earnings (Heckman selection), childcare enrollment and prices (random forest), employment (random forest), taxes (percentile-based donor matching), and SPM poverty units.

2. **Calibration** - Estimates CRRA demand parameters (beta, rho) by targeting empirical elasticities. Backs out household-level preference heterogeneity (alpha matrices) from observed/imputed choice probabilities.

3. **Simulation** - For each year: ages the population, applies macro projections, loads policies, and solves for market equilibrium. Post-equilibrium, expands with Gumbel epsilon shocks and collapses to discrete choices via argmax.

4. **Output** - Writes level summaries and delta files (scenario minus baseline), generates formatted Excel workbooks.

## Key Design Features

### Equilibrium

Solves for market-clearing prices across four care sectors (unpaid center-based, low-priced center-based, high-priced center-based, paid home-based) using L-BFGS-B with warm-start from the previous year. Demand is multinomial logit over (employment, care type, care hours) choices; supply is constant elasticity labor supply. For quantity-limited policies, sector offer rates are additional equilibrium objects solved by a nested root-find at each price evaluation (state-conditional choice probabilities don't depend on the offer rates, so the inner solve operates on precomputed per-state aggregates).

### Parent Unit Types

Families are classified into 2 types by number of children:
- **c1**: 1-child families (45 choice alternatives)
- **c2plus**: 2+ child families (675 choice alternatives)

Each choice combines: primary caregiver employment (FT/PT/NW) x child care arrangements (type x hours per child).

### Two-Stage Choice Simulation

1. **Equilibrium**: Uses softmax probabilities (smooth, differentiable)
2. **Post-equilibrium**: Expands with Gumbel epsilon shocks, collapses to discrete choices via argmax

### Effect Decomposition

Results decompose policy impacts into mechanical (pure generosity change at baseline behavior) and behavioral (additional impact from changed choices) components.

## Policy Channels

The simulator supports five independent policy channels, all specified per-scenario in the runscript CSV:

| Channel | Config directory | Function | Description |
|---------|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| Demand subsidies | `config/policy_demand/` | `do_demand_policy()` | Returns subsidy matrix (n_units x n_choices) |
| CDCTC | `config/cdctc/` | `do_cdctc_policy()` | Child & Dependent Care Tax Credit |
| Supply | `config/policy_supply/` | `do_supply_policy()` | Transforms market prices to supplier-received prices |
| Tax credits | `config/policy_tax/` | `do_tax_policy()` | CTC-like credits that modify total tax by employment status |
| Employer subsidies | `config/employer_subsidy/` | YAML config | Percentage or dollar wage subsidies to providers |

See existing policy files for function signatures and examples.

### Quantity-Limited (Rationed) Demand Policies

Demand policies can limit program slots by paid sector (e.g., New York's 2K
program). Offers are drawn **per eligible child, per rationed sector** as
independent Bernoulli lotteries; the equilibrium solves sector offer rates
(nested inside each price evaluation) so that expected take-up — counted in
weighted children — equals the slot count, or the offer rate hits 1 with slack
when the program is undersubscribed.

A rationed policy file (see `config/policy_demand/ny_2k_style.R`) additionally
defines:

- `rationing$slots` — length-4 slot counts by market sector (sector 1 must be
  0), or a `function(year)` for a slot schedule (program ramps should use this
  rather than the runscript `phase_in_years` column, to avoid double-counting)
- `is_child_program_eligible(parent_units_df, child_idx)` — which units' child
  can enter the lottery (must match the eligibility the subsidy function
  applies internally)
- `do_demand_policy(..., offered1, offered2)` — offer-conditional subsidies

Existing (unrationed) policies need no changes. Post-equilibrium, the discrete
stage draws actual offers per record from a dedicated RNG stream (epsilon
draws stay aligned with the baseline) and persists them as `offer_child*.j`
columns. The mechanical effect uses **Option A**: baseline records inherit the
policy run's offer draws, so mechanical take-up intentionally differs from the
slot count (windfall to lottery-winning inframarginal users; see
`docs/mechanical_effect_rationed_programs.html`). Per-scenario diagnostics
land in `models/equilibrium/rationing_<year>.csv` (slots, offer rates,
expected/realized/mechanical take-up) and in the solver results file.

Rationed policies are supported for counterfactual scenarios only (not the
baseline).

## Runscripts

Scenarios are defined in CSV files under `config/runscripts/`. Example from `report_runs.csv`:

```csv
id,policy_demand,policy_supply,policy_cdctc,policy_tax,employer_subsidy,wage_floor,years,phase_in_years
baseline,baseline,baseline,baseline,baseline,none,none,2026:2055,
universal,universal,baseline,baseline,baseline,none,none,2026:2055,5
means_tested,means_tested,baseline,baseline,baseline,none,none,2026:2055,5
```

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `id` | Scenario identifier (first row must be `baseline`) |
| `policy_demand` | Demand policy file (without `.R`) |
| `policy_supply` | Supply policy file |
| `policy_cdctc` | CDCTC policy file |
| `policy_tax` | Tax policy file |
| `employer_subsidy` | Employer subsidy config (without `.yaml`) |
| `wage_floor` | Wage floor config (without `.yaml`) |
| `years` | Year range, colon-separated (e.g., `2026:2055`) |
| `phase_in_years` | Optional linear ramp from 0% to 100% over N years |
| `state` | Optional state-level analysis: USPS postal code(s), semicolon-separated (e.g., `NY` or `NY;CA`). Absent/blank/`all` = national run |

Not all columns are required. Simpler runscripts (e.g., `speed_test.csv`) can omit columns that have defaults.

## State-Level Analysis

Setting the `state` runscript column runs the simulation per state instead of
nationally (see `docs/state_level_analysis.md` for the full design):

- Processing and calibration run unchanged at the national level; households
  are filtered to the state at simulation initialization (before any
  `--sim-sample` subsampling).
- **Demand**: if `config/state/demand/<ST>.csv` exists (base-year 2019 annual
  hours by care type, 7 non-parental types), the calibrated alpha matrices
  are re-anchored via a per-care-type contraction so state base-year
  aggregates match; otherwise the state uses national alphas, filter only.
- **Supply**: `config/state/supply/<ST>.yaml` (same schema as
  `estimation/supply/supply_2019.yaml`) replaces the NSECE-derived parameters
  when present.
- **Employment growth**: `config/state/employment/<ST>.csv` (same schema as
  `resources/epop/epop_projections.csv`) replaces the national CBO epop
  projections when present; base-year employment rates always come from the
  state-filtered data.
- Multiple states run as independent equilibria (a within-year loop); all
  summary tibbles gain a `state` column and per-state output is written under
  `simulation/{scenario_id}/states/<ST>/`. Run provenance (deltas, supply and
  epop sources) is recorded in `metadata/state_analysis.yaml`.

State runs require an interface generated after state support was added
(`STATEFIP` in the ACS pull and `p0`/weights stored with the alpha matrices);
older interfaces fail loudly at initialization. Known v1 limitations (state
income taxes, national wage/CPI growth factors) are documented in the design
doc.

Each scenario also gets an Excel workbook with formatted summary tables.

## SLURM Parallelization

Simulation years can be processed in parallel via SLURM job arrays:

```bash
./slurm/launch_array.sh -r report_runs -a 20 -n 20 -N 202602052017 -f
```

Three-phase architecture: (1) setup — processing + calibration, (2) year workers — one SLURM array task per year, (3) finalize — combine results and write output.
